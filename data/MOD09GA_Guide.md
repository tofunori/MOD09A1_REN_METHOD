# 1. Product description
MOD09 (MODIS Surface Reflectance) is a seven-band product computed from the MODIS Level 1B land bands 1 (620-670 nm), 2 (841-876 nm), 3 (459-479), 4 (545-565 nm), 5 (1230-1250 nm), 6 (1628-1652 nm), and 7 (2105-2155 nm). The product is an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance for each band as it would have been measured at ground level as if there were no atmospheric scattering or absorption. It corrects for the effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols.

# 2. Overview of MODIS processing
Most satellite data processing systems recognize five distinct levels of processing. Level 0 data is raw satellite feeds: level 1 data has been radiometrically calibrated, but not otherwise altered. Level 2 data is level 1 data that has been atmospherically corrected to yield a surface reflectance product. Level 3 data is level 2 data that has been gridded into a map projection, and usually has also been temporally composited or averaged. Level 4 data are products that have been put through additional processing. All data up to and including level 2 are in an ungridded orbital swath format, with each swath typically cut into small segments, or **granules**, to facilitate processing. Data at level 3 and up are geolocated into a specific map projection, with the geolocated products typically in a set of non-overlapping **tiles** (figure 1).

The advantage of level 3 data over less processed forms of data is that each pixel of L3 data is precisely geolocated; a disadvantage is that the process of compositing or averaging that results in L3 data limits the usefulness of the L3 product. The Level 2G format, consisting of gridded Level 2 data, was developed as a means of separating geolocating from compositing and averaging. The L2G format preserves all the data that maps to a given pixel as observations at that pixel. Programs which produce level 3 data can then have all available data at each pixel to choose from, without having to geolocate everything themselves. An additional step of processing, level 2G-lite, provides a minimal level of compositing of daily level 2G data.

## 2.1. MODIS surface reflectance data products
MODIS surface reflectance data are found in the MOD09 series of data products, including a level 2 product (MOD09, generated by PGE11's MOD_PR09.exe program), level 2G daily products (MOD09GHK, MOD09GQK, and MOD09GST, generated by PGE12's MOD_PRMGR.exe program), level 2G-Lite daily products (MOD09GA and MOD09GQ, generated by PGE13's MOD_PR09G.exe program), level 3, 8-day composited products (MOD09A1 and MOD09Q1, generated by PGE21's MOD_PR09A.exe program), and daily level 3 CMG (climate modeling grid) products (MOD09CMG and MOD09CMA, generated by PGE75's MOD_PR09C.exe program). See Table 1.

Please note that not all MOD09 products are publically available. This User's Guide is meant to be a guide for the use of publically available MOD09 products, so it is the publically available products that are described here in detail. Other products are described for the sake of completeness (e. g., the MOD09IDN, -IDT and -IDS products).

### Table 1: Inputs and outputs of MODIS surface reflectance programs.

where '2GL' stands for level 2G-lite and resolutions ('res.') are '5', 0.05¬∞, 'Q', 250 m, 'H', 500 m, and '1', 1 km.

**Please also note:**
1) A **collection** is a MODIS data archive that has been reprocessed in order to incorporate better calibration, algorithm refinements, and improved upstream products into all MODIS products. The current collection is 6. Later collections supersede all earlier collections.
2) This table focuses upon MOD09-related products, and for purposes of clarity omits pointer files, coarse-resolution files, browse files, ancillary data files, destriped L1B input files, subsets, et cetera.
3) The "MOD" prefix should be taken as referring to the dataset in general, *not* to Terra-derived data in particular. All programs discussed in this document process either Terra- or Aqua-derived data. All datasets referred to in this document will be referred to as "MOD" data, but meaning either Terra-or Aqua-derived data.

## 2.2. Products of MOD_PR09.exe -- levels 2 and 3
`MOD_PR09.exe` is run on whole orbit's worth of level 1B calibrated radiance data at each available resolution (1 km, 500 m and 250 m). Daytime data is corrected for the effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols. Specifically, bands 1 and 2 at 250 m, bands 1 through 7 at 500 m, and bands 1 through 16 at 1 km are corrected, yielding an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance for each band as it would be measured at ground level if there were no atmospheric scattering or absorption. Band quality control information for the correction is also generated (e. g., flags denoting if ancillary data is unavailable, if L1B data is faulty, etc.), for each resolution, and for bands 1 through 7.

The level 2 MOD09 output includes all corrected bands and band quality data, as well as aerosol retrieval data and data for assessing the quality of the aerosol retrieval algorithm (brightness temperature data from thermal bands 20, 31 and 32, water vapor data, path radiance data, et cetera). Data is written to the output files as Scientific Data Sets (SDSs). One additional data set of importance is the 1 km State QA SDS. While band quality SDSs contain information about the quality of the atmospheric correction of each pixel, the State QA SDS contains information about the pixel's **state** ‚Äì that is, characteristics of each pixel that are not dependent upon band or resolution. Each State QA pixel contains data such as whether the pixel has been flagged as land, deep ocean, shallow ocean, or as containing cloud, high aerosol, low aerosol, snow, or fire. State QA data reflects the qualities of the pixel itself, not the quality of any of the surface reflectance data.

Other outputs of `MOD_PR09.exe` are the MOD09 Intermediate Surface Reflectance datasets (MOD09IDN, -IDT and -IDS), in which all surface reflectance data and band quality data for each orbit are geolocated into a linear latitude and longitude projection at 5 km (0.05¬∞) resolution. Data in these files is averaged. These files are intermediate in the sense that they serve as inputs to `MOD_PR09C.exe`, which composites MOD09IDN, -IDT and -IDS files for each orbit into daily MOD09CMG and MOD09CMA files.

## 2.3. Products of MOD_PRMGR.exe -- level 2G
`MOD_PRMGR.exe` is run for each tile in the MODIS sinusoidal grid (figure 1) for each day, and is run on all MOD09 level 2 granules that map to the tile for that day. The number of observations at each pixel is determined not only by the number of orbits at that location (one at the equator and up to 15 at the poles), but also by the spread of observational coverage of off-nadir pixels.

**Figure 1.** The MODIS sinusoidal grid consists of 460 nonoverlapping tiles which measure approximately 10¬∞ x 10¬∞. Data from an example tile (tile h11v05, derived from MOD09A1.A2000337.h11v05.005.2006342055602.hdf) is shown as a RGB-image.

The resulting data can be conceived of as forming a three-dimensional cube, with its depth determined by the number of observations at each pixel. The L2G data is written to output files in two parts: the first part consisting of "first layer" data, data at zero depth in the cube, as a 2-dimensional SDSs; and the second part as either "full format" data (the rest of the observations as 3-dimensional SDSs) or as "compact format" data (the rest of the observations with all fill values removed and written as one-dimensional SDSs). The format operationally generated is the compact format.

The level 2G output includes MOD09GHK (500 m surface reflectance and band quality data), MOD09GQK (250 m surface reflectance and band quality data), and MOD09GST (1 km State QA data). These datasets were archived until collection 5, when they were superseded by level 2G-lite products (see below). Apart from having been geolocated, the 1 km State QA dataset is identical to the State QA in MOD09 files.

## 2.4. Products of MOD_PR09A.exe -- level 3
`MOD_PR09A.exe` is run for each tile in the MODIS sinusoidal grid for each 8-day period. Up to and including collection 4, it was run on all MOD09GHK, -GQK and -GST files for that tile and 8-day period. As of collection 5, it is run on all MOD09GA and MOD09GQ files for that tile and 8-day period. All data in input files that map to a given pixel are called observations. The MOD_PR09A compositing process selects the best observation for each pixel. The criteria for selection include observational coverage and view angle, and whether the observation is flagged as cloudy, clear, containing high aerosol or low aerosol, or in cloud shadow.

For each pixel, the compositing steps are:
1) Observations from the same orbit are composited by observational coverage. Observations with the highest coverage are saved, and the rest discarded. This yields a list of one observation from each orbit.

2) Each orbit's observation is then assigned a score, based upon whether it is flagged for cloud, cloud shadow, high aerosol or low aerosol, or contains high view angle or low solar zenith angle. The lowest score, 0, is assigned to observations with fill values for data. The remaining scores are:
    * `1 BAD` data derived from a faulty or poorly corrected L1B pixel
    * `2 HIGHVIEW` data with a high view angle (60 degrees or more)
    * `3 LOWSUN` data with a high solar zenith angle (85 degrees or more)
    * `4 CLOUDY` data flagged as cloudy or adjacent to cloud
    * `5 SHADOW` data flagged as containing cloud shadow
    * `6 UNCORRECTED` data flagged as uncorrected
    * `7 CLIMAEROSOL` data flagged as containing the default level of aerosols
    * `8 HIGHAEROSOL` data flagged as containing the highest level of aerosols
    * `9 SNOW` data flagged as snow
    * `10 GOOD` data which meets none of the above criteria

The observation with the highest score and the lowest view angle is selected for the MOD09A1 and MOD09Q1 outputs.

The MOD09A1 outputs also contain a 500 m version of the 1 km State QA composited from all 8-day inputs.

## 2.5. Products of MOD_PR09G.exe -- level 2G-lite
Each observation in the L2G 'cube' is added not in any meaningful order, but in the order it is read from level 2 files ‚Äì so, data in the "first layer" is not inherently more useful than the compact format data. In spite of this, however, in time the "first layer" of the L2G outputs became all that most users paid attention to. In the level 2G-lite format, efforts were made to improve the quality of the "first layer" data by sorting the observations in a manner similar to the selection process of `MOD_PR09A.exe` (above). The sorting of observations also eliminated the need for several SDSs in the level 2G pointer files, which reduced the overall volume of each day's data.

## 2.6. Products of MOD_PR09C.exe -- level 3 CMG
The MODIS Surface Reflectance Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) format is level 3 and global; its projection is in linear latitude and longitude (Plate Carre), and its resolution is 0.05¬∞ (figure 2). It is derived from MOD09IDN, MOD09IDT and MOD09IDS files for each orbit by compositing the data in these files on the basis of minimum band 3 (459 - 479 nm band) values (after excluding pixels flagged for clouds and high solar zenith angles). The MOD09CMG file contains surface reflectance for bands 1 through 7, band quality data and other important information, but does not contain retrieved aerosol data -- aerosol data is put into a separate file, the MOD09CMA file.

| 6-7 | | 110 | 75.0 - 87.5% |
| 6-7 | | 111 | 87.5 - 100.0% |

**Note:** The orbit number is not the absolute orbit number but a relative orbit number in the file. In addition a flag is stored which distinguishes between observations which are in the top half of the scan (the first 5 1 km scan lines in the along track direction) and the bottom half of the scan (the last 5 1 km scan lines). The observation coverage is the area of intersection of observation footprint and cell divided by the area of the observation.

# 4. Frequently asked questions.
## 4.1. How are MODLAND QA bits set, and how should they be used?
The MODLAND QA bits are bits 0 and 1 of the band quality SDS pixel values. They are meant as a brief summary of quality control aspects of each pixel, with ‚Äò00' meaning the best possible atmospheric correction and any other value indicating errors or problems, and serving as a flag to check other QA data in more detail. Although the MODLAND QA bits are still set in this manner, other band quality bits and other QA products (e. g., the State QA) have superseded the MODLAND QA bits in importance.

**a) `MOD_PR09.exe` processing.**

In the `MOD_PR09.exe` program, the MODLAND QA bits are initialized to '00' and
